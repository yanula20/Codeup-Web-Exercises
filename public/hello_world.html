	<h1>My favorite vehicle</h1>
		<p>I own a 1995 Ford Explorer. It is the second vehicle that I've owned and it is my favorite. I bought it used in 1996 while stationed on Oahu, Hawaii. It has served me well with no break-downs at all. I've driven it between duty stations in Virginia and California four times. F.O.R.D. is not an acronym for Fix Or Repair Daily like some people would claim. I would recommend a Ford to anyone.<br>
